### Important Notes
1. Run `npm install` command in both client and server folders.
2. Run `cp .env.example .env` command in both client and server folders.

4. Run both server and client side with `npm start`


This project works properly on Google Chrome, but if you want to run it on Firefox, 
you need to change the arpegee/client/src/index.js file accordingly.
